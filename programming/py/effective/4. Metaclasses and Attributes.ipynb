    "# Metaclasses and Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaclasses are often mentioned in lists of Python’s features, but few understand what they accomplish in practice. The name `metaclass` vaguely implies **a concept above and beyond a class**. Simply put, **metaclasses let you intercept Python’s class statement and provide special behavior each time a class is defined**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly mysterious and powerful are Python’s built-in features for **dynamically customizing attribute accesses**. Along with Python’s object-oriented constructs, these facilities provide wonderful tools to ease the transition from simple classes to complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **with these powers come many pitfalls**. Dynamic attributes enable you to override objects and cause unexpected side effects. Metaclasses can create extremely bizarre behaviors that are unapproachable to newcomers. It’s important that you **follow the rule of least surprise** and **only use these mechanisms to implement well-understood idioms**."
